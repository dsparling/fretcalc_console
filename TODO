TODO list:

 - allow user selectable config file (-i?)
 - add default/selectable config file parsing to FretCalculator
 - or sub in main
 - add fret-to-fret calculation
 - add single fret calculation
 - add "highest fret number" for dulcimer either in 
   conjuntion with or to replace number of frets
   (highest fret number and number of frets aren't the same
    if "+" frets are included)
 - add conversion between metric and enlish systems
 - add fractions (nearest 1/64")
 - add old rule of 18 and Sloan 
 - allow user to name output file
 - allow user to set max number frets
 - use vector instead of MAX_FRETS
 - allow common scale lengths (enter 'fender' instead of 25.5)
 - nicer formatting of output
 - use getopt (flags with no values [-d] must come first)
   currently can't combine flags (-oV)
 - GUI
 - change Makefile to write binary to directory in $PATH
 - man page
 - combine print_calc() and write_calc()
 - combine frets_calc() and ducl_calc()
